# Overview

This repository contains a set of tutorials for analysis of shuffling patterns during grain boundary (GB) migration to accompany the papers: 

1. Chesser, Ian, Brandon Runnels, and Elizabeth Holm. "A taxonomy of grain boundary migration mechanisms via displacement texture characterization." Acta Materialia 222 (2022): 117425.

2. Chesser, Ian, Elizabeth Holm, and Brandon Runnels. "Optimal transportation of grain boundaries: A forward model for predicting migration mechanisms." Acta Materialia 210 (2021): 116823.

# Tutorial Code 

**Example 1**: <br/>
Analyze displacement texture as a post-processing step of an atomistic simulation with a known initial and final state before and after migration. 

**Example 2**: <br/>
Example application of the forward model to predicting migration mechanisms of the Sigma 5 (100) twist GB
